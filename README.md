<p id="description">This is a simple calculator application that was created using Android Studio Kotlin. It‚Äôs one of the basic projects I built and it wasn‚Äôt too difficult at all‚Äîit works perfectly! This application is ideal for students who want to start with something straightforward and engaging.</p>
